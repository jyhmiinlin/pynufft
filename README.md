# PyNUFFT: Python non-uniform fast Fourier transform


A minimal "getting start" tutorial is available at http://jyhmiinlin.github.io/pynufft/ .

### Summary

PyNUFFT attempts to implement the min-max NUFFT of Fessler and Sutton, with the following features:

- Based on Python numerical libraries, such as Numpy, Scipy (matplotlib for displaying examples).
- Provides 1D/2D/3D examples for further developments.
- Support of PyCUDA and PyOpenCL. 
- LGPLv3
